## Installation

It is recommended to install this package with `mamba` (see below). If you don't have `mamba` installed, you can install it with `conda`. We start the guide by installing Mini-`conda`.

### Install Miniconda

First step required to use the pipeline is installing Miniconda. If you already have a working Anaconda setup you can go directly to the next step. Anaconda can be downloaded for all platforms from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). We suggest to use Miniconda, because it is lighter and install fewer unnecessary packages.

To download Miniconda, open a terminal and type:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Then install by typing:

```bash
bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

and follow the installation instructions. The Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh file can be safely deleted.

### Install `plant-seg` using `mamba`

Fist step is to install mamba, which is an alternative to conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
```

PlantSeg version >= v1.6.2 is required. If you have a nvidia gpu, install `plant-seg` using:

```bash
mamba create -n plant-seg -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge pytorch pytorch-cuda=12.1 pyqt lcerrone::plantseg
```

or if you don't have a nvidia gpu, install `plant-seg` using:

```bash
mamba create -n plant-seg -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge pytorch cpuonly pyqt lcerrone::plantseg
```

## Inference

### Example configuration file for both training and inference

The original configuration file used for training the final UNet PlantSeg model published on Bioimage.IO for wide applicability can be found at `plantseg/configs/config_train_final.yml`, which is a configuration file for [pytorch-3dunet](https://github.com/wolny/pytorch-3dunet), the core network of PlantSeg.

An example config file for segmentation can be found at `plantseg/configs/config_pred_wide_applicability.yaml`. To modify it and use it for your own data, you need to change the `path` parameters:

- `path`: path to the folder containing the images to be segmented or to the image to be segmented

You may also need to change these parameters:

- `preprocessing:factor`: a rescale factor to match the nucleus size of your data to the training data, not necessary but may help in specific cases
- `cnn_prediction:patch`: patch size should be smaller than the dimension of your image, and smaller than the GPU memory

The full configuration file is shown below:

```yaml
# Contains the path to the directory or file to process
path: PATH_TO_YOUR_DATA

preprocessing:
  # enable/disable preprocessing
  state: True
  # key for H5 or ZARR, can be set to null if only one key exists in each file
  key: Null
  # channel to use if input image has shape CZYX or CYX, otherwise set to null
  channel: Null
  # create a new sub folder where all results will be stored
  save_directory: 'PreProcessing'
  # rescaling the volume is essential for the generalization of the networks. The rescaling factor can be computed as the resolution
  # of the volume at hand divided by the resolution of the dataset used in training. Be careful, if the difference is too large check for a different model.
  factor: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
  # the order of the spline interpolation
  order: 2
  # cropping out areas of little interest can drastically improve the performance of plantseg.
  # crop volume has to be input using the numpy slicing convention [b_z:e_z, b_x:e_x, b_y:e_y], where b_zxy is the
  # first point of a bounding box and e_zxy is the second. eg: [:, 100:500, 400:900]
  crop_volume: '[:,:,:]'
  # optional: perform Gaussian smoothing or median filtering on the input.
  filter:
    # enable/disable filtering
    state: False
    # Accepted values: 'gaussian'/'median'
    type: gaussian
    # sigma (gaussian) or disc radius (median)
    filter_param: 1.0

cnn_prediction:
  # enable/disable UNet prediction
  state: True
  # key for H5 or ZARR, can be set to null if only one key exists in each file; null is recommended if the previous steps has state True
  key: Null
  # channel to use if input image has shape CZYX or CYX, otherwise set to null; null is recommended if the previous steps has state True
  channel: Null
  # Trained model name, more info on available models and custom models in the README
  model_name: 'PlantSeg_3Dnuc_platinum'
  # If a CUDA capable gpu is available and corrected setup use "cuda", if not you can use "cpu" for cpu only inference (slower)
  device: 'cuda'
  # (int or tuple) padding to be removed from each axis in a given patch in order to avoid checkerboard artifacts
  patch_halo: [64, 64, 64]
  # how many subprocesses to use for data loading
  num_workers: 8
  # patch size given to the network (adapt to fit in your GPU mem)
  patch: [192, 256, 256]
  # stride between patches will be computed as `stride_ratio * patch`
  # recommended values are in range `[0.5, 0.75]` to make sure the patches have enough overlap to get smooth prediction maps
  stride_ratio: 0.50
  # If "True" forces downloading networks from the online repos
  model_update: False

cnn_postprocessing:
  # enable/disable cnn post processing
  state: True
  # key for H5 or ZARR, can be set to null if only one key exists in each file; null is recommended if the previous steps has state True
  key: Null
  # channel to use if input image has shape CZYX or CYX, otherwise set to null; null is recommended if the previous steps has state True
  channel: 1
  # if True convert to result to tiff
  tiff: True
  # rescaling factor
  factor: [1, 1, 1]
  # spline order for rescaling
  order: 2

segmentation:
  # enable/disable segmentation
  state: True
  # key for H5 or ZARR, can be set to null if only one key exists in each file; null is recommended if the previous steps has state True
  key: 'predictions'
  # channel to use if prediction has shape CZYX or CYX, otherwise set to null; null is recommended if the previous steps has state True
  channel: 1
  # Name of the algorithm to use for inferences. Options: MultiCut, MutexWS, GASP, DtWatershed
  name: 'GASP'
  # Segmentation specific parameters here
  # balance under-/over-segmentation; 0 - aim for undersegmentation, 1 - aim for oversegmentation. (Not active for DtWatershed)
  beta: 0.5
  # directory where to save the results
  save_directory: 'GASP'
  # enable/disable watershed
  run_ws: True
  # use 2D instead of 3D watershed
  ws_2D: False
  # probability maps threshold
  ws_threshold: 0.4
  # set the minimum superpixels size
  ws_minsize: 50
  # sigma for the gaussian smoothing of the distance transform
  ws_sigma: 2.0
  # sigma for the gaussian smoothing of boundary
  ws_w_sigma: 0
  # set the minimum segment size in the final segmentation. (Not active for DtWatershed)
  post_minsize: 100

segmentation_postprocessing:
  # enable/disable segmentation post processing
  state: True
  # key for H5 or ZARR, can be set to null if only one key exists in each file; null is recommended if the previous steps has state True
  key: Null
  # channel to use if input image has shape CZYX or CYX, otherwise set to null; null is recommended if the previous steps has state True
  channel: Null
  # if True convert to result to tiff
  tiff: True
  # rescaling factor
  factor: [1, 1, 1]
  # spline order for rescaling (keep 0 for segmentation post processing
  order: 0
  # save raw input in the output segmentation file h5 file
  save_raw: False

```

### Prediction

```shell
plantseg --config CONFIG_PATH
```

where CONFIG_PATH is the path to the YAML configuration file. For example, if you want to use the model with the example configuration file `configs/config_pred_wide_applicability.yaml`:

```shell
cd ovules-instance-segmentation/plantseg/
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 plantseg --config configs/train_and_infer.yml
```

### Specifying a Graphic Card (GPU)

If you need to specify a graphic card, for example to use the No. 7 card (the eighth), do:

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=7 plantseg --config CONFIG_PATH
```

If you have only one graphic card, use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` to select the first card (No. 0).
